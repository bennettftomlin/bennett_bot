1490,@ReaverBait @RXFrench No one is claiming that you cannot be fat and relatively healthy. I believe his claim is that for a fat person it will almost always be healthier for them if they safely diet and lose weight
1491,@RXFrench @byVanessaNorth Correct. But I remember the fat acceptance community jumped on it
1492,@RXFrench @byVanessaNorth Exactly. That's literally why my site exists. So that I can do the analysis and show which studies control for which factor and use that to explain results
1493,@RXFrench @byVanessaNorth My thought is it might be so uncommon as for there to be no good statistics on it
1494,@RXFrench @byVanessaNorth Second one suggested it's better to be overweight and active than thin and sedentary. But neither of those prove her point here
1495,@RXFrench @byVanessaNorth There was a pair of studies that came out a few years ago that I remember people trying to use to make this point. First one suggested dieting could have negative health effects (dieting was poorly done).

1523,@RXFrench Yes. For once we are fully in agreement
1524,So in short my point is that focusing on whether or not this was technically sexual assault (for the record I do not think it was legally) is missing the bigger opportunity we have here to discuss the reason this is still an issue and to enter into a discussion about consent 7/7
1525,"What we have here is an opportunity to show why clear, enthusiastic, affirmative consent is so important.  It shows that you are respecting the other person and their autonomy. 6/"
1526,And we have failed women by teaching through media and through conversations that men pressuring them is a normal part of the sexual act. 5/
1527,It is a useful opportunity for us to pause and consider the various societal forces at play here.  We have failed men by conditioning them to feel as though in order to receive sex they need to cajole and pressure women. 4/
1528,If the account is accurate then we need to realize that there are several points at which it should have been obvious she was uncomfortable and that the encounter should not have progressed.  Almost everyone reading it will agree to that. 3/

1900,"@BJefferson33 @hdegreve13 I actually definitely did not miss that point.  That's why I said it's a big deal, wrote and called all my congressmen, and have taken all the appropriate steps to protect it.  It's just not accurate to use those terms in that way and is in my opinion a fallacy of equivocation"
1901,@BJefferson33 @hdegreve13 Also I am very much in favor of net neutrality.  I just feel the misuse of these terms surrounding it is sensationalistic and can promote a misunderstanding of civics and government structure
1902,@BJefferson33 @hdegreve13 Not in a classical sense.  Censorship is generally regarded to be the government limiting your access to information and this does not fit that.  You could argue this is no more censorship than twitter removing Milo Yiannopoulus

1904,@hdegreve13 The language of right is dangerous here as you can see elucidated in the federalist papers and later in writings about differences between positive and negative rights in political philosophy
1905,"@hdegreve13 It in no way implies that. It solely protects the right of people to publish what they would like. Again if I write my thoughts down on a pamphlet, the act of writing is protected but I can‚Äôt make a store distribute it"

1957,@RXFrench Tricky case. I still feel like there is no reason for a person to care for another. Closest moral justification I've seen for that is deontology but that obviously leads to problems
1958,@RXFrench Nah. You can withdraw support though and they become a ward of the state
1959,@RXFrench Isn't that what basically every medical ethics department and legal case study has established in terms of withdrawing life support?
1960,@RXFrench You have to define living here. How do they simultaneously have the desire to live and no way to communicate it? They have full brain activity but not even the ability to blink?
1961,@RXFrench If that person has the legal authority to do so yes. Meaning that this person can no longer communicate and the person making the decision has the appropiate legal authority
1962,@RXFrench Easy solution. We'll just make standard abortion procedure severing the umbilical cord and placenta and inducing labor. That would constitute withdrawing support
1963,@RXFrench No more than withdrawing support from someone on life support
1964,@RXFrench Switch it from termination to withdrawing support and the issue disappears
1965,@RXFrench The extremes illuminate the issue and allow us to move past the abortion is murder/killing narrative to understand the moral philosophy

1974,@RXFrench Citing the fact we don't do that is the philosophical move made
1975,"@RXFrench Which is the move often made, but this is a little bit different. Say to save some random person you need to be connected to them through some tube. Would it be your obligation to keep them alive?"

2949,@RXFrench @sef0208 leaving at the end what? Just men's football and women's volleyball as the mandatory alternative?
2950,@RXFrench @sef0208 meaning you can't have any of the unprofitable women's sports close

2954,@RXFrench only division 1? Every NCAA player?
2955,@RXFrench what this really shows is we need a semi pro league that offers payment to players until they become eligible
2956,@RXFrench how do you distribute that
2957,@RXFrench how would you fairly distribute that
2958,@RXFrench which means the school can't use the profit from profitable sports to pay for unprofitable sports
2959,"@RXFrench I have no objection to that, I think every person should always have the right to market their own image"
2960,@RXFrench because sports like football fund other not profitable sports
2961,@RXFrench however I am in favor of them giving full health protection

5972,@mathias_not @kid_swamp https://t.co/ihUqJalC21
5973,@mathias_not @kid_swamp Fine. There is a collective agreement that the government may collect taxes as dictated by their elected representatives and that people can vote against these representatives and even eliminate this ability to tax at any time. In return they receive protection and services

5982,@EthanEhlers I think tax-advantaged funding of HSA's is a good thing and I would still support private companies offering Part C advantage plans
5983,@kid_swamp @mathias_not It's also important to realize reduction or elimination of other social services can reduce massive marginal tax rates which can currently act as a disincentive to work and to earn
5984,@kid_swamp @mathias_not If you want an interesting and different perspective on UBI I would read Friedman's writings about his Negative Income Tax
5985,@kid_swamp @mathias_not And you're right it could create dependency which is why I would only want it at a bare minimum level. Necessities for survival and almost nothing more. I want to keep a very strong incentive for work
5986,"@kid_swamp @mathias_not I actually don't want to raise taxes that significantly. Cutting defense spending by 50% or greater, while simplifying basically every existing welfare program into UBI are likely to represent a massive cost savings. If there is still a deficit then taxes need to be raised"
5987,"@kid_swamp @mathias_not For the record I can't see what Mathias is saying because my fictional platform that included ""Most importantly: Destroy Bitfinex"" was apparently block worthy"
5988,@kid_swamp @mathias_not Where do you see massive governmental control or power in that platform there? When I say Medicare for All I do not mean nationalized healthcare. I mean people can buy into and pay the premiums for Medicare
5989,@kid_swamp @mathias_not How many more people would be willing to start businesses if they knew they had healthcare? Would be willing to try an innovative idea as long as they knew they had the bare essentials to survive whether or not the idea panned out
5990,@kid_swamp @mathias_not I think providing a bare minimum (and I mean bare) minimum living standard for each person provides an opportunity to vastly increase capitalistic output by allowing greater utilization of people
5991,"@kid_swamp @mathias_not Yeah that money has been taxed, but the recipient did not create economic activity to generate it. Most logical place to tax it. Better job of allocating money is a bit of a red herring. It can be more succinctly stated as providing adequate social safety network"

6525,@KyleSGibson @pokkst Oh wait this is about my blog post
6526,@KyleSGibson @pokkst Kyle your last medium article was about hacks
6527,@KyleSGibson @pokkst What I'm saying is next contentious issue that could theoretically result in a fork (like the block size debate before) is going to be a ton of fun
6528,"@KyleSGibson @pokkst Yeah I went down this same path with my thread about mining last night. I think CZ is trying to either estimate his maximal influence, or signal how large it is"
6529,@pokkst What I should say is risk of miner defection from 'bribe' increases with each successive confirmation decreasing probability of reorg even beyond that which would be predicted by accumulated POW
6530,"@pokkst Exactly, that's why probability drops off rapidly for each additional confirmation. But 1-block could likely be incentivized imo"
6531,"@pokkst I think with 1 conf, assuming CZ was willing to lose the entire hacked amount to prevent the hacker from having it the probability is significantly non zero"
6532,"@pokkst The game theory that is supposed to prevent is the harm to the exchange long term, and the risk of defection of miners"
6533,@pokkst This was proposed pretty earnestly around the 2016 BFX hack too. It also plays pretty well with the probabilistic nature of confirmations. Larger a transaction the greater the accumulated proof of work needed for probabilistic finality. Problem is exacerbated as issuance falls

6647,@NelsonMRosario @CasPiancey That is a really bad take
6648,@CasPiancey @NelsonMRosario You are not wrong
6649,@CasPiancey And no matter what they already have that data. Do you realize how many DUA's and Business Associate agreements the average hospital has? It's a ridiculous number. This is a non-significant increase.
6650,"@CasPiancey Actually I checked my dates, it was 8th grade"
6651,@CasPiancey When you're using it as a weapon with the goal of inspiring terror quick is good
6652,@CasPiancey Which again healthcare data is protected and you cannot be compelled to release it to employer (unless it's a workman's comp claim and then only information relevant to that claim)
6653,"@CasPiancey That too (awesome in the sense of awe-inspring not good), we thought it would end up being used as a bioweapon"
6654,@CasPiancey I think the privacy concerns are less immediate with health data than with other data because it is required to be protected to a certain degree and you have established recourses
6655,@CasPiancey Did I ever tell you I started mocking up my dream implantable biometric monitoring device when I was a seventh grader?
6656,@CasPiancey They're required to. Fines are enormous if you violate it
6657,@CasPiancey Even without if you have WiFi on it it'll pick up nearby wifi networks or will use the cell towers to get your general location
6658,@CasPiancey Apple can't see your data in Health. We discussed that fact before. And presumably the results of the blood test would be transmitted in FHIR format over a HIPPA compliant encrypted line
6659,@CasPiancey Health data is hacked from hospitals relatively infrequently
6660,"@CasPiancey Plus if you have your phone on you they have your location, if you pay your copay with a credit card they have that"

8464,What can you do? Demand the newest version of the climate survey. Demand the administration audit previous Title IX cases for impropriety and censure or remove employees found to breach standards. Call for the Greek Judicial and Standards board to uphold standards. 33/

8467,"In 2018 there was reporting from the Observer on the so called ""Rophynol Amendment"" that was passed by every fraternity.  This reporting was inaccurate. 30/"
8468,This group has the ability to sanction any group not living up to the standards of the Greek system.  Their failure to act seems to imply they feel that there has been no breach of the standards of the Greek system which is disturbing. 29/

8476,Now we must consider the actual Title IX process which poses its own series of concerns. There is a significant pressure on people who report to choose an informal resolution instead of a formal hearing. I was told a hearing in Feb. 18 was the first that school year. 21/
8477,Augustana has had a chronic problem for decades e that they have failed to deal with and are still actively failing to deal with. 20/

8479,If you were at the spring 2018 SGA forum you heard Title IX members say they had no idea things were this bad on campus.  They had access to this data so they either lied to us or are grossly incompetent.  Neither is acceptable. 18/

9157,@CasPiancey @bossafin Imagine it took Bitfinex $10m to start Tether.  They end up with $2b in customer deposits.  At 1% interest per year that is $20m each year.  That can easily pay back initial investment with comfortable margin for original investor.

Patients bringing family with
Physical plus (physical and specific complaint or specific test (EKG or PFT))

Sometimes 40:

Medicare age patient who has significant (~6) 20 minute appointments before them"
10501,"Heuristics:
Auto 40:
Medicare patient new to office
Welcome to Medicare Visit
Transition of Care for Medicare Patient
Patient older than 50 new to practice who we do not have records for.
Physical for NP
Often 40:
Medicare pre-op
Patients 85 and older"
10502,"So I have come up with my own rules I am currently codifying for my replacement, but often it still comes down to my judgement or intuition and that always makes me nervous"

2. Desire to run on time."

1. Is bad because people are different. 
2. Is bad because we don‚Äôt have the science to back them up"
10911,@ummjackson There is also a subtle distinction here that is often missed by the acolytes. Namely eating for a disease (say epilepsy) may require eating a SUBOPTIMAL diet for general health. Same way any other treatment can have side effects and second level effects
10912,@NelsonMRosario @ummjackson Because it‚Äôs inconvenient

16716,Hey $tslaq I present you the Clybourm (near Chicago) Tesla lot including a Tesla with mismatched panels https://t.co/YQ1cX39QKU
16717,Why was Bitfinex implementation of Bitgo different? Why was the security audit never released? Why is there no audit of Bitfinex or Tether? How did they convert that many BFX tokens so quickly? Those are the questions that need to be answered. 18/18
16718,So why does this mean a single day attestation will never have value? Because it does not prove the money always existed when the Tethers were created. 17/
16719,"The obvious answer to me is that they must have been created without backing. In order to finish the conversion of BFX tokens, though it is difficult to say for certain because the auditor was dismissed. 16/"
16720,So since we know Bitfinex and Tether are deeply linked businesses and Tethers are only supposed to be created in response to traders or institutions depositing money with Tether where could these Tethers have come from? 15/
16721,The rest were redeemed for ‚Äúcash‚Äù. Now why do I keep putting cash in quotes? That would be because of this recording of Phil Potter where he stated he intended to convert them to Tethers. https://t.co/mJ6TyVug1q 14/
16722,"BFX tokens could be redeemed either for equity in Bitfinex or you could hold them until they could be converted to cash from the profits of Bitfinex. ~30% converted to equity, arguably at an inflated valuation as Bitfinex did not disclose they had lost banking 13/"
16723,"First we need to realize some of the biggest recipients of the BFX tokens were Bitfinex management, which seems worrisome to me. 12/ https://t.co/q7oz6thu3I"
16724,Now we need to go back to discussing the BFX tokens. Most users got a haircut and they received the number of BFX tokens equal to the dollar value of their haircut. Why is this problematic? Well because of how it was redeemed mostly. 11/
16725,Friedman was eventually fired. The stated reason was that they were too thorough in trying to audit Tether. No mention was made of their promised audit of Bitfinex. 10/
16726,"Eventually after this hack Friedman LLP was hired to perform and audit and here again things get difficult. Friedman only ever publicly commented on Tether, however previously Bitfinex had claimed they were hired to audit Bitfinex as well. 9/ https://t.co/m8wiS25RbN"

16730,"""BitGo systems were not breached in this attack and our software functioned correctly. This may seem like an inadequate explanation, because everyone wants to know ‚Äúwhat needs to change to avoid what happened in this case,‚Äù and we understand that..."" 5/"

16944,@karbonbased @CasPiancey @duudl3 @_tdubey For example you find out they have a specific negative reaction to a certain chemo drug and you have narrowed down their potential pharmacogenomics

17035,@Chris_Iceland @karbonbased @JWilliamsFstmed Wrong medicine administration dropped by a massive amount. Combined with CDS systems to prevent prescription of drugs with interactions/allergies/similar spellings it significantly improved patient care
17036,If your blockchain requires trusted input from human oracles it's no more accurate than a centralized database and harder to correct. #centralizetheworld
17037,@Chris_Iceland @karbonbased @JWilliamsFstmed Actually there's already systems implemented at many major hospital systems to do all this for over a decade with zero blockchains
17038,@Chris_Iceland @karbonbased @JWilliamsFstmed All of that can be done with a regular EHR
17039,Your blockchain based solution probably really just needs interoperability between existing databases. #centralizetheworld
17040,@Chris_Iceland @karbonbased @JWilliamsFstmed I never advocated for the status quo.  In a different place in response to this tweet I already outlined my suggestion to improve the status quo.
17041,@Chris_Iceland @karbonbased @JWilliamsFstmed I don't.  I think blockchain is a non-solution to those problems.
17042,"@Chris_Iceland @JWilliamsFstmed We live in a world with 150 competing EHR's with very little interoperability.  Blockchain solves none of the real and existing hard problems, but insteads add in additional cost, complexity, and competing standards."
17043,"@Chris_Iceland @JWilliamsFstmed I was going through the University of Chicago's cohort constructor for their data warehouse and found that there was an option to select patients with a high hemoGOBLIN level and there were over 1,000 pts with this typo"
17044,@Chris_Iceland @JWilliamsFstmed I'm aware of all those things and I'm also aware of the regulatory hurdles that make all them worthless.  Have you ever looked at a live EHR?  Immutability is the last thing it needs.
17045,@Chris_Iceland @JWilliamsFstmed Doesn't answer my question.  There is no reason automated devices cannot feed into a centralized traditional EMR.
17046,@Chris_Iceland @JWilliamsFstmed How does blockchain make it more accurate?
17047,@Chris_Iceland @JWilliamsFstmed How are they more efficient on a blockchain? Seems to me they would be less efficient because querying is more difficult?
17048,@Chris_Iceland @JWilliamsFstmed Size doesn't mean much? How are you distributing Zettabytes of data to multiple nodes?
17049,@Chris_Iceland @JWilliamsFstmed Because you're talking about Zettabytes of data with increasing use of genomics
17050,"@Chris_Iceland @JWilliamsFstmed Also let's say I hack an encrypted database, what do I do next?  I have a bunch of bits and bytes that are meaningless to me because I do not have the key"

17271,@JWilliamsFstmed @CasPiancey @jasonrockwood @SarahJamieLewis And blockchain doesn‚Äôt help it work. Best solution is PHRs designed to work with multiple EHRS. wanna make it compelling to the EHR? build on an automated check in feature which shares preloaded demographics allergies and meds

Imagine I have $100 and so I issue 100 Tethers.

17696,@C1aranMurray My point is there is a time delay between when the money is spent and when the tether hits the treasury. During that entire time period they are not backed in the manner they claim. Not necessarily an important functional distinction but could be important legally
17697,@C1aranMurray Let‚Äôs say they have 100 bills in backing and there are 100 bills outstanding. They spend 1 dollar to buy one Tether. Until that Tether is transferred to the treasury they have 100 bills outstanding and 99 bills in backing

18974,@RXFrench Cas-9 was initially hyped as minimal off targets and it‚Äôs only recently we realized how significant off targets effects were
18975,@RXFrench Let‚Äôs wait a little bit and make sure in replications off targets are controlled
18976,Plus depending on how you define it you could say that we have already conclusively proven Tether manipulated the market
18977,"I feel for the authors. This is a hard industry to analyze. Exchanges will start wash trading on a whim, copy others order books, and generally lie."
18978,If you analyze EOM returns and forget that futures on CME close EOM https://t.co/UTLUBgplP3

18980,@EatSleepCrypto Same place as the old paper
18981,@KyleSGibson Paper imo is interesting but inconclusive
18982,"@KyleSGibson Could be a couple things:

1. People using Tether prints/movements as indicator for algos/trading
2. Coincidence
3. Manipulation 

They insufficiently supported 3 and it is very plausible based on what we have read and seen that it was 1"
18983,Tether movements respond to premium as expected which is comforting
18984,@KyleSGibson I think some of the statistical tests and placebo and dummy are flawed
18985,"They also try to look at flows and the USDT/USD pair. This is interesting, but I would not expect much meaning here. Kraken is/was the biggest market for this and has had limited liquidity. Plus if we accept Tether is commonly used to avoid KYC then many would never go to Kraken"
18986,@ha1331 I think the second. There is interesting data in here and I am tempted to start a project where I pull down a bunch of data and start doing some of my own analysis on it
18987,Bitfinex also does not always disclose all their reserve wallets and so this analysis can methodologically be difficult
18988,"Paper also uses EOM outflows from Bitfinex reserves to support narrative of Bitcoin selling to back. 

However if I remember right other exchanges were gaining on Bitfinex and for this test IMO they should have compared to a different 3 day period each month for Bitfinex"
18989,"The behavior around 9/15 for Friedman check is more compelling with a 25% drop. However, I believe they were not supposed to know the date for Friedman check so this narrative requires significant cooperation between these entities"
18990,Authors do not discuss how futures for CME close EOM and this could affect bitcoin returns EOM

Can't.  It says the pair does not exist."

we get this, which shows a much more believable $1,093,229,056.41(and by believable I mean I believe that is what the exchanges are reporting)"
22193,"Here is the API output for a custom average, using their weighted average of exchanges from Tether to Bitcoin. https://t.co/a8jmpYom37

It shows a total Tether volume in the last 24 hours of $1.  It also shows a meaningless last update value."
22194,"Also in talking to them we asked if there was a way to determine the total Tether volume, and they said not currently and suggested we instead try to use their API to calculate it.  Well I tried that and this is where things get weird."
22195,"Furthermore, they seem to report Bitfinex volume directly with no adjustment, despite the fact that Bitfinex has admitted to wash trading.
https://t.co/bsjygAMqPZ"

22639,@SoakerPatoshi What do you mean?
22640,@CasPiancey @SoakerPatoshi This too.
22641,@SoakerPatoshi Because timing is a bitch.
22642,@SoakerPatoshi I have publicly recommended that no one goes short
22643,@SoakerPatoshi I have zero dollars short bitcoin.
22644,@SoakerPatoshi How?
22645,@SoakerPatoshi The motive is to maintain trust in Tether. Nefarious or benevolent is where we would strongly diverge
22646,@SoakerPatoshi More from the fees they can attract with new traders. Though I'm sure many are holders and would benefit from a price increase
22647,@SoakerPatoshi My intuition though again I no longer have proof is that they may benefit more from the volume than they lose in fees
22648,@SoakerPatoshi I see the point you're getting at. Clever. You make a good point
22649,"@SoakerPatoshi I'm not attempting to imply that. I believe there are traders who use wash trading to lower their fees, and also possibly (though I have no empirical truth) Bitfinex may be wash trading the USDT/USD pair to maintain the peg on Kraken"
22650,@SoakerPatoshi Regardless it increases the expected value of their portfolio
22651,@SoakerPatoshi That applies specifically to Tether not for wash trading in general
22652,@SoakerPatoshi Which is why I initially separated traders who may be doing it from exchanges. Incentives are different for each
22653,@SoakerPatoshi Breaking the peg could potentially cause a dangerous loss in faith. More about avoiding loss than profiting
22654,@SoakerPatoshi What?
22655,@SoakerPatoshi Also someone like Bitfinex could benefit by helping to maintain the peg of something like Tether
22656,@SoakerPatoshi What do you mean where do they cash out? They either cash out by paying less in fees or attracting new money to sell into
22657,"@SoakerPatoshi They can benefit by dropping into a lower fee tier (see Kraken), they can benefit by drawing in new investors (see coinmarketcap)."

22659,@retracementron0 @karbonbased It's been a long few weeks us out here. We're all getting meaner

22661,@SoakerPatoshi On tiered fee exchanges can reduce fees paid by the traders. For exchanges can make them appear much larger than they are. Disguising liquidity can increase number of people who want to purchase.

22723,@mrmikelujan @karbonbased @CasPiancey @zeroshorts You don‚Äôt get it. Tether collapse causes liquidity crunch. Causes price to drop precipitously.

22743,@mrmikelujan @CasPiancey @zeroshorts You literally just said price does not correspond to value.
22744,@mrmikelujan @CasPiancey @zeroshorts The value of crypto is what value it creates. It‚Äôs a speculative asset so price does not correspond to value but a potential future value
22745,@mrmikelujan @CasPiancey @zeroshorts It certainly should be if there is a flaw that can be seen in it. Learning of a new flaw should drop your valuation.
22746,@mrmikelujan @CasPiancey @zeroshorts These coins are all illiquid. Try to sell into that market cap and watch it collapse.

22899,@keremtibuk @ButtCoin How do you think the cyanide process influenced this?
22900,@realLudvigArt No. I‚Äôm imagining one that intended to inflate ad infinitum
22901,@realLudvigArt I agree
22902,@karbonbased I had three people unfollow after this post but I‚Äôm back to it
22903,"@keremtibuk @ButtCoin Also total crime needs to be kept low enough to keep trust. 

Also all of this is immoral and should be punished."
22904,@keremtibuk @ButtCoin Imagine there is some capital already invested in a super productive way. No benefit to stealing that and entering it back into economy. Now imagine someone sleeps on a pile of dollar bills. Better for that to enter the economy.
22905,@realLudvigArt This is one of the reasons I don‚Äôt like proof of stake. Too tempting for stakers to increase their rewards
22906,@realLudvigArt Without a doubt I see your point. But in this same vein wouldn‚Äôt we expect a system that started with consistent inflation tend towards zero inflation as stakeholders try to avoid dilution
22907,@karbonbased https://t.co/8sU3KFxX8a
22908,@realLudvigArt You may be right
22909,@realLudvigArt You could say consensus derives from humans just as easily for Bitcoin and it has not moved it‚Äôs cap
22910,@realLudvigArt Code it into programmable money and make it difficult to get consensus to fork it ;)
22911,@realLudvigArt So perhaps what I truly desire is a small but consistent inflation
22912,@realLudvigArt I‚Äôm aware of time preference. I‚Äôm just imagining things like Apple pre return of jobs that look bad and then are great investments

22914,"@realLudvigArt Perhaps, but misallocation can be difficult to determine beforehand"
22915,@keremtibuk @ButtCoin Also didn‚Äôt the panic of 1893 happen in this period? It‚Äôs not my specialty but I remember learning that
22916,@realLudvigArt Perhaps. There are many things I do not know and many things I think I know where actually I am mistaken. However I have always felt deflation disincentives investment in high risk capital intensive ventures
22917,@keremtibuk @ButtCoin You‚Äôre confusing my saying theft could benefit economic growth with the statement that all theft would benefit economic growth. Subtle difference.

23767,@SoakerPatoshi @KyleSGibson Sure.
23768,@SoakerPatoshi @KyleSGibson I am missing how regulation exacerbates it
23769,@SoakerPatoshi @KyleSGibson Yeah starting from the premise wash trading and fake money is good seems odd
23770,@KyleSGibson @SoakerPatoshi That gave me an idea for a SpongeBob meme
23771,@YangVentures 5 years from today
23772,@SoakerPatoshi You're working from the assumption I do not want to destroy Tether. I do.
23773,@SoakerPatoshi Many do not have the choice as to whether or not to use them because many exchanges are Tether only and even those who do not use those exchanges are exposed to the systemic risk
23774,@SoakerPatoshi So you believe the vast majority &gt;80% of people who use Bitfinex are aware they're trading Tethers and not dollars?
23775,@SoakerPatoshi It is fraud to promise something and not deliver it. Therefore Tether is fraudulent. Full stop.
23776,@SoakerPatoshi Let's move away from this and focus on the simple fact that Tether is fraudulent and vastly increases the attack surface of cryptocurrencies
23777,@SoakerPatoshi Except you are basically forced to accept Tether because it provides so much liquidity and volume for Bitcoin
23778,@SoakerPatoshi I am not
23779,@SoakerPatoshi What do you mean price of Tether?
23780,@SoakerPatoshi I'm saying regulations already exist that make wash trading commodities illegal
23781,@APompliano @karbonbased How confident are you in this Facebook call?
23782,@SoakerPatoshi Yes.
23783,@SoakerPatoshi What do you mean?
23784,@SoakerPatoshi The entire cryptocurrency marketspace is being defrauded because Tether+Bitfinex provides 70% of volume and more on non-BTC coins
23785,@SoakerPatoshi Also the old the market will appropiately discount Tether trick doesn't work because they wash trade and maintain the peg
23786,@SoakerPatoshi Calling for an audit is calling for them to live up to their promises
23787,@SoakerPatoshi I do feel there could be a meaningful audit and they fired the auditor doing it. I don't give a rat's ass about the fed because it's outside my circle of competence
23788,"@SoakerPatoshi The sane way to make a stable coin like this if you are forced to make one is to create an asset backed stable coin that is exchangeable and audited. An unaudited, unexchangeable stable coin controlled by a single entity is antithetical to the goals of the entire space"

24186,@YangVentures Too bad those don't exist or I'd have some
24187,The margins still might not work but it's more interesting to me
24188,I'm imagining a 14.99/month/person add-on. You could see any of the Netflix movies that theater was showing for free and see other movies for a small surcharge (say $1.99). Netflix gets a cut of non subscribers who see their movies and theater gets exclusive rights to play those
24189,Okay crazy idea and I'm not sure if this would work but what if $NFLx competed with $hmny. Would probably need to done with a single chain and would likely involve that theater chain gaining the right to screen certain Netflix content. Might make the margins more workable

24223,"@bccponzi Yes. I was thinking they would want to trade into Tether in an attempt to get into fiat ASAP, because I know Tether is sometimes used for interexchange arbitrage, however they could also choose BCH or LTC. Advantage of Tether is no fees"
24224,@rodarmor Oh yes that's the advantage I'm forgetting.  Tether exchanges have no fees
24225,"@rodarmor That's a question I actually need to look up.  I know Tether is frequently used for inter-exchange arbitrage, but when I'm thinking about it since it is based on the Bitcoin blockchain I don't see why exchanges would accept less than six confirmations same as Bitcoin"
24226,"@rodarmor Actually you may be right, I'm just assuming they'll want to get into Fiat quickly, and it would be easiest to trade USDT into USD on Kraken"
24227,@rodarmor Possibly.  My thought is they will want to get into fiat ASAP and it is sometimes easier to transfer Tether interexchange than BTC (I may be mistaken on this or it may be exchange dependent)
24228,"Yeah only Bitfinex, Kraken, OKeX, Huobi, and oh my god it's all of them https://t.co/wrxQ9Tb1xv"

24231,"There is another possibility though.  Using Omni like Tether does they have the ability to freeze every single Tether in existence.  I cannot even imagine what happens in this scenario.  I know it will be ugly, as everyone desperately tries to trade into other cryptos"
24232,"After this, crypto will have a chance to rebuild with more honest underpinnings."
24233,"Then everyone sells their Bitcoin and tries to cash out at once, into a market with no buyers, no volume, and Cumberland Mining likely pulls their market making bots, this will cause the single largest crash in Bitcoin to date.  Bigger than MTGOX"
24234,"This will cause Tether exchanges to actually have a HIGHER price of Bitcoin temporarily, then as the Bitcoin is transferred to fiat exchanges to cash out, fiat exchanges will have a premium"
24235,"This Tether will then be transferred to Kraken and will be attempted to be traded for USD, however Kraken will likely freeze withdrawal of fiat.  What will happen next is that Tether will break it's peg and go UP.  People will be be changing every other crypto into Tether."
24236,"My guess is we will see the peg break down on Kraken first.  Insiders will know first that something is wrong (insiders always know first, Bitfinex loves talking to Whalepool).  They will immediately sell their crypto on whatever Tether exchange they are using for Tether"
24237,What exchange will show weird price action first?  My best guess is it will actually not be Bitfinex which is the obvious choice.  Bitfinex is a large exchange and has Cumberland Mining help them spoof and maintain liquidity.
24238,"Since today gave us a preview I want to discuss briefly what it will probably look like when Tether fails. (I am not a psychic, just thinking logically).  First thing you will notice is weird price action on a Tether exchange."

24807,"Why do I want to cut down the number of recipes?

I want very basic rudimentary skills to be taught. 

The internet is clogged with recipes we do not need more. 

We need coherent instruction that allows people to access, understand, and modify those recipes"
24808,@CasPiancey @81TC01N @ExkrementKoin I think we also need to consider something @YangVentures has pointed out before. It‚Äôs hard to hide on Twitter. If you cannot think clearly it is obvious to those who can
24809,"However, I think if you set your branches up different, and cut down the number of recipes you could make it a valuable resource. Would likely have to be digital though, which is not ideal for cookbooks"
24810,I‚Äôve actually been thinking about the cooking one and it‚Äôs a tricky prospect. @then_there_was has written about it before. Basically people come in with vastly different skill sets and expectations. I think @tferriss came closest to cracking it with The Four Hour Chef
24811,"Then I‚Äôm also free to chase down and research any topic that fits my fancy.

25818,"@AFDudley0 @prestonjbyrne @rhhackett No, I understand that fact.  For the use-cases described in the whitepaper you need it to maintain it's peg on exchanges though.  Furthermore, past performance of CDP liquidation is meaningless in a black-swan event"
25819,@AFDudley0 @prestonjbyrne @rhhackett In order for Dai to be used as described in the whitepaper it needs to be able to hold a 1:1 peg within a relatively tight margin.  They have shown without the bots they cannot do that.
25820,"@AFDudley0 @prestonjbyrne @rhhackett That's supposed to be their global settlement option, and their penalty ratio which are supposed to maintained by MKR holders in the DAO"
25821,"@AFDudley0 @prestonjbyrne @rhhackett Best case, they dilute the Pooled Ether and hope that the value comes back up, and worst case you lose your claim on your original collateral.  It's already slightly diluted, and there have been no serious, rapid, crashes."
25822,@AFDudley0 @prestonjbyrne @rhhackett And if the value of the Ether held plummets quickly before a global settlement can be triggered (in accordance with the whitepaper) then it is no longer collateralized.

26850,"@Hibero5 @antiprosynth @twobitidiot I agree it would be detrimental and that is why intuitively I think they would go after the promoters and not the platforms.  If they did decide to go after the platform I think easier than taking down miners would be to regulate the fiat on ramps, I do not expect that however"
26851,"@JamesTodaroMD @twobitidiot That's a very fair point, and it is very possible they treat it as basically too big to fail"
26852,"@Hibero5 @antiprosynth @twobitidiot It would be a calculated risk in my opinion.  They are increasing their regulatory risk for as long as he is present, but it may be worth it for the net gain in quality of the platform"
26853,"@Hibero5 @antiprosynth @twobitidiot EOS is weird in my opinion to be discussing because it is still pre-product  And it would be unfortunate because he is a brilliant developer, who has done incredible work, but I still feel he represents a serious attack surface to Ethereum as a whole"

26867,"@antiprosynth @Hibero5 @twobitidiot One of the initial promises of Ethereum was that it would be immutable. This was advertised by the Ethereum foundation, and yet they along with all of the social following of Vitalik support a chain that has been proven to not be immutable"
